# Learning-Tube
A decentralised application where users can upload, stream, and watch lectures online using LivepeerStudio, Bundler and Arweave with Nextjs as the client framework, on the polygon Mumbai Testnet. It is a platform that can serve as a learning environment for institutions to set up a livestream, online lecture, upload past recorded lectures for students to watch and learn.

# Overview
I used NextJs to build the client-side of the project then i used Livepeer to integrate the livestream (liveClass) feature then lecturers may use their stream keys in other broadcasting applications to host a live class. The next feature is to upload videos on the platform using Bundler and Arweave, this feature is still under *development* 

# Plans and Objectives
To improve the UI/UX of the platform for a better experience.
To Complete the project and implement more technologies on the platform.
To launch the Learning-Tube on the Mainnet.
